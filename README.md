# PluginBase

PluginBase is an extensive library designed to streamline the creation of Spigot plugins. This
library provides a solid foundation to build upon, making plugin development more efficient and
manageable.

The majority of my public Spigot
plugins ([CommandButtons](https://github.com/demengc/CommandButtons), [RankGrant+](https://github.com/demengc/RankGrantPlus), [UltraRepair](https://github.com/demengc/UltraRepair),
etc.) and private projects are using PluginBase!

## Modules

### pluginbase-core

The main module containing the core functionality of PluginBase. A rough, incomplete overview of the
features is as follows:

- Schedulers (async/sync runnables, delayed/repeated tasks, etc.)
- Text utilities (i.e. colorizing strings with HEX and Adventure support, centered messages,
  components,
  etc.)
- Localization/translation system
- Event handling and listener registration
- Serialization from immutable equivalents of Bukkit objects to YAML
- Custom GUIs with deserializable buttons
- Cooldown maps
- Chat input requests
- Item builder
- GSON provider
- Custom YAML configuration files
- SpigotMC resource update checker
- Cross-version compatibility utilities

### pluginbase-games

A framework for creating minigames. Uses a state-based system to allow for efficient handling of
games that are composed of multiple stages (i.e. preparation phase, fighting phase, celebration
phase, etc.).

### pluginbase-sql

A module for handling SQL databases using the connection pooling
library [HikariCP](https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP). Some features include connection
management, credential deserialization, statement handlers (prepared statements), result set
handlers, and sync/async queries/executions.

### pluginbase-mongo

A simple module that allows for easy connections to MongoDB databases.

### pluginbase-redis

A module that facilitates cross-server communication using Redis publish-subscribe messaging. Capable
of handling objects.
